# X-Space Clone
# 🐦 Twitter Clone (Mini Social Feed)

A simple Twitter-like web application built using **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** that allows users to:
- Select a user from a dropdown
- View that user's posts (tweets)
- Click a post to view comments
- Display user profile details like bio, location, and more

Data is fetched from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free REST API for testing and prototyping.
